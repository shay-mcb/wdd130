    <h2>Shay McBride</h2>
    <p>Hey there! I'm Shay and I'm an exercise physiology major from South Texas!</p>
    <p>I'm a nerd about a lot of different things, some of which include competitive smash bros, cooking, writing, yoga, and playing guitar. I'm taking this class so that I'll have a basic understanding of how to build a website when I start an online business next year.</p>
    <p>Excited to get to know y'all!</p>
